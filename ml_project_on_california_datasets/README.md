# ML Project on California Housing Dataset

This project focuses on predicting housing prices in California using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes features such as median income, housing age, total rooms, bedrooms, population, households, and geographic location. The goal is to accurately estimate house prices and identify key factors affecting them.

## Project Highlights

- **Data Preprocessing:**
  - Handling missing values
  - Scaling numerical features
  - Encoding categorical variables

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Visualizing feature distributions
  - Identifying correlations with the target variable

- **Machine Learning Models:**
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor

- **Model Evaluation:**
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - RÂ² Score

- **Overfitting Prevention:**
  - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize models and improve generalization

- **Insights & Conclusion:**
  - Key factors influencing housing prices
  - Comparative performance of different models

This project demonstrates practical skills in **data preprocessing, visualization, model building, evaluation, and tuning**, making it a comprehensive example of applying machine learning to a real-world dataset.
