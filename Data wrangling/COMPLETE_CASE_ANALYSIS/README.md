# Data Handling and Analysis Project

## Description
This project focuses on **data handling, cleaning, and basic exploratory analysis** using Python and pandas. The goal is to **prepare raw datasets for analysis or modeling** by handling missing values, checking distributions, and comparing original vs cleaned data.  

Key steps include:  
- Identifying missing values and calculating their percentages  
- Dropping or filling missing values (Complete Case Analysis / CCA)  
- Comparing distributions of original vs cleaned data using histograms  
- Analyzing categorical data by comparing proportions before and after cleaning  
- Preparing the dataset for further analysis or machine learning  

This project demonstrates practical **data preprocessing techniques** often used in real-world data science workflows.

## Features
- Calculation of missing data percentages per column  
- Histograms to visualize original vs cleaned distributions  
- Comparison tables for categorical data proportions  
- Easy-to-read and reproducible Python code  

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository  
2. Load your dataset into a pandas DataFrame  
3. Run the provided Python scripts/notebooks to clean and analyze the data  
4. Check the outputs: missing value percentages, cleaned distributions, and comparison tables
