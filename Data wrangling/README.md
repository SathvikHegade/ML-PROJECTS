# Data Wrangling & EDA Project

## Description
This project demonstrates **data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA)** using Python and pandas. The goal is to **prepare raw datasets for analysis or machine learning** by cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data.  

Key steps include:  
- Identifying and handling missing values  
- Dropping or filling missing data (Complete Case Analysis / CCA)  
- Comparing distributions of original vs cleaned data using histograms  
- Analyzing categorical data by comparing proportions before and after cleaning  
- Preparing datasets for further modeling or ML workflows  

This project showcases practical **data preprocessing techniques** that are essential in real-world data science and ML pipelines.

## Features
- Calculate missing data percentages per column  
- Visualize distributions before and after cleaning with histograms  
- Compare categorical data proportions before and after cleaning  
- Easy-to-read, reproducible Python code  

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**  
- **pandas**  
- **matplotlib**  

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository  
2. Load your dataset into a pandas DataFrame  
3. Run the provided Python scripts/notebooks to clean and analyze the data  
4. Check outputs: missing value percentages, cleaned distributions, and comparison tables  

## Future Improvements
- Add automated data cleaning functions  
- Include feature engineering for machine learning  
- Add interactive visualizations using Plotly or Seaborn
