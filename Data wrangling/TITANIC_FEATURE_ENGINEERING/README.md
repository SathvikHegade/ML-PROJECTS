# Titanic Data Analysis & Preprocessing

## Description
This project focuses on **cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing the Titanic dataset** using Python and pandas. The goal is to **prepare the dataset for analysis or predictive modeling** by handling missing values, engineering features, and exploring the data visually.  

Key steps include:  
- Handling **missing values** with strategies like dropping or filling (`dropna`, `fillna`)  
- **Feature engineering**:  
  - Extracting titles from names  
  - Creating categorical and numerical features  
  - Transforming columns like `Cabin` into useful formats  
- Calculating **percentages of non-missing values** per column  
- Visualizing **distributions before and after cleaning** with histograms  
- Analyzing **categorical columns** by comparing proportions  

This project demonstrates practical **data preprocessing techniques** essential for **machine learning pipelines**.

## Features
- Identify missing data and calculate percentages  
- Clean and transform both numerical and categorical features  
- Compare original vs cleaned data distributions using histograms  
- Analyze and visualize categorical variables  
- Prepare dataset for further modeling or machine learning  

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**  
- **pandas**  
- **matplotlib**  
- **NumPy**  

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository  
2. Load the Titanic dataset CSV file into a pandas DataFrame  
3. Run the provided Python scripts/notebooks to clean, preprocess, and analyze the data  
4. Check outputs: missing value percentages, cleaned distributions, and comparison tables  

## Future Improvements
- Add **more feature engineering** like family size or age groups  
- Include **predictive modeling** using classifiers like Logistic Regression or Decision Trees  
- Add **interactive visualizations** using Plotly or Seaborn
